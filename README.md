There are many classification models, all with their own accuracy, percision, and recall. How to know which is the best model? Which classification metrix is the best to use to find the best model? Accuracy, percision, recall, and other metrics all have their advantages and disadvantages. Each model has different values for each metrix. These values are normally depended on the dataset used to train them. The Chess (king-rook vs. king-pawn) data set is a perfect example to test classification models on. There are two categrories that can be used as classes, that is "nowin" and "won". Due to these being the only way to categorize the data in this dataset, regression models will just not do for the dataset. That makes the Chess dataset to be perfect for classifications models.
